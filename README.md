Fun with Numbers - Algorithm Calculator
This project is a simple web application that allows users to perform various mathematical operations (such as sum, average, median, mode, etc.) on a list of numbers. The user can input a list of numbers separated by commas, select an operation from the dropdown, and get the result displayed on the screen.

Features
Supported Operations:
Sum: Adds all the numbers together.
Average: Calculates the average of the numbers.
Min: Finds the minimum value from the list.
Max: Finds the maximum value from the list.
Median: Finds the median of the numbers.
Mode: Finds the mode (most frequent number) in the list.
Range: Finds the difference between the largest and smallest numbers.
Input: Accepts a list of numbers separated by commas.
Dynamic Calculation: The calculation is triggered by clicking the "Calculate" button.
Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the webpage.
JavaScript: For implementing the core logic of mathematical operations.
CSS: (Optional) You can style the webpage using Tailwind CSS or any other CSS framework.
How to Use
Enter numbers: In the input field, enter a list of numbers separated by commas. For example:

Copy code
4, 7, 2, 9, 5
Select an operation: Choose a mathematical operation from the dropdown (Sum, Average, Min, Max, Median, Mode, or Range).

Click "Calculate": Press the "Calculate" button, and the result will be displayed below.
